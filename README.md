## 💪 Motivation

Changing your DNS proxy settings should be quick and convenient. That's why it's surprising that Smart DNS Proxy has an extremely limited [API](https://www.smartdnsproxy.com/MyAccount/API). 

If you wanted to toggle US Netflix for instance, you would need to navigate through the Smart DNS Proxy website. It would be much easier to have all the settings in an upfront UI. That is the use case the Smart DNS Proxy Settings app handles.
